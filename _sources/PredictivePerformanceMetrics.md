# Predictive Performance Measues

As a measure of model predictive performance measures a set of the most common hydrological model predictive performance measures 
such as - the Nash Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), Kling-gupta (KGE), Percent Bias (PBIAS) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient are 
included in HydroBench. Two versions of these metrics are adopted - the untransformed and their log trasformed version. 
These two metrics are suited to evaluate model predictive perormance in capturing the different segments of a hydrograph. 
Table 1 provides the metrics, their performance skills, and syntax in HydroBench.

For their application, please refer to the Example notebook section at the end of this JupyterBook.
