# Hydrological Signature Measures

HydoBench consists a selected hydrological signature measures such as:

1. Flow Duration Curve (FDC)
2. Time linked Flow Duration Curve (T-FDC)
3. Streamflow recession curves, and 
4. Water balance (runoff coefficient). 

Table 2 provides the syntax, description and equations of the above four hydrological process signatures. 
For their implementation, please refere to the example notebook. 

In addition to the above four hydrological signatures, 
HydroBench is interfaced with the matlab based Toolbox for Streamflow Signatures 
([TOSSH](https://tosshtoolbox.github.io/TOSSH/)) functions. 
This interface allows HydroBench users to access a wide ranging 
hydrological signature measures in diagnosing model performances.
