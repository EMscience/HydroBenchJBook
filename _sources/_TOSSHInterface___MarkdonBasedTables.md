Consequently, recession curves can indicate a model’s performance in characterizing subsurface processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Plot of Time Linked Flow Duration curve (T-FDC) and its value for a given number of diagonal. |              | … With: observed streamflow number of diagonals to consider model streamflow                 | As FDC does not have a time component in revealing under- and overestimation of flows, we developed T-FDC, which complements FDC by incorporating a time component. For a given day observed streamflow, T-FDC tracks whether a model estimate results in the same bin, higher or lower bin. This makes it to be analogous to the confusion matrix and requires binning of the data according to the observed minimum and maximum values. T-FDC is a (visual) metric between FDC and hydrograph. Thus T-FDC eases the interpretation of a hydrograph by simplifying it to be within a specific bin count. |
